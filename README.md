# SomatosensoryCortex_FunctionalFingertipAtlas
These are label files generated with FreeSurfer 6 that indicate the Position of Thumb (D1) and Little Finger (D5) on the contralateral hemisphere. 
The regions were determined from a cortical fMRI mapping of a fingertip stimulation task for left and right hand fingertips. The sample size was 
about 20 participants. More details follow soon.
