# SomatosensoryCortex_FunctionalFingertipAtlas
These are label files generated with FreeSurfer 6 and the fMRI data analysis pre-processing tool available in this reporistory. The label indicates the Position of Thumb (D1) and Little Finger (D5) on the contralateral hemisphere across cytoarchitectonic area 1 and area 3b of the somatosensory cortex. 
The regions were determined from a cortical fMRI mapping of a fingertip stimulation task for left and right hand fingertips. The sample size was 
about 20 participants. More details in:
